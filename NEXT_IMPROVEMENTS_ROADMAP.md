**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Current Status:** Agent Grade A, Production-Ready  
**Focus:** Incremental enhancements for even better performance

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Tier 1: Quick Wins (High Value, Low Effort)

### 1. Add Equity Field Documentation & Calculation Helper

**What it is:**
- Document that `fundamentals` doesn't have equity field
- Add note that equity = total_assets - total_debt
- Add example showing how to calculate equity for ROE

**Why valuable:**
- Prevents 3 failed extraction attempts we saw in tests
- Agent currently tries to extract `total_stockholders_equity` which doesn't exist
- Self-corrects but wastes 3 tool calls
- **Impact:** Save 3 tool calls per multi-company analysis

**How to implement:**
- Add to data schema section: "Equity not available, calculate as assets - debt"
- Add example: "For ROE calculation, use key_metrics file or calculate equity"
- **Effort:** 5-10 minutes

**Expected benefit:**
- 18% fewer failed tool calls (3/17 â†’ 0/17)
- Faster execution (no retry cycles)
- Cleaner logs

---

### 2. Add "Comparison Query" Detection Pattern

**What it is:**
- Add explicit pattern in prompt: "When comparing N companies, use batch operations"
- Guide agent to plan batch extractions and calculations upfront
- Suggest optimal workflow for comparison queries

**Why valuable:**
- Agent already uses batch, but could be more systematic
- Could extract ALL data in fewer calls (currently 6 extractions, could be 3)
- Pattern recognition helps agent optimize automatically
- **Impact:** Further reduce tool calls for comparison queries

**How to implement:**
```markdown
## Common Query Patterns

### Multi-Company Comparison
When comparing 2+ companies:
1. Fetch all companies in parallel (mf-market-get Ã— N)
2. Extract all metrics using batch extraction (1 call per company)
3. Calculate all ratios using batch calculation (1 call total)
4. Create comparison table (mf-render-comparison)
5. Provide final analysis

Expected tool calls: 3 + N + 1 + 1 = N + 5
```

**Effort:** 15-20 minutes

**Expected benefit:**
- More consistent batch usage
- Predictable tool call patterns
- Easier to optimize further

---

### 3. Add Common Financial Ratios to key_metrics Schema

**What it is:**
- Document what ratios are already available in key_metrics
- List: ROE, ROA, P/E, P/B, debt-to-equity, current ratio, etc.
- Show agent when to use pre-calculated vs calculate manually

**Why valuable:**
- Agent might calculate ratios that already exist
- Wastes tool calls on calculations
- Pre-calculated ratios are instant (no calculation needed)
- **Impact:** Avoid unnecessary calculations

**How to implement:**
```markdown
### key_metrics_quarter.json - Available Ratios

**Pre-calculated ratios (use these!):**
- roe, roa (profitability)
- peRatio, pbRatio, priceToSalesRatio (valuation)
- debtToEquity, debtToAssets (leverage)
- currentRatio, quickRatio (liquidity)
- grossProfitMargin, operatingProfitMargin (margins)

**Calculate manually:**
- Custom ratios not in key_metrics
- Ratios using extracted fundamentals data
```

**Effort:** 10 minutes

**Expected benefit:**
- Avoid 1-2 unnecessary calculations per query
- Faster execution
- Use authoritative pre-calculated values

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Tier 2: Medium Value Enhancements (1-2 days each)

### 4. Add Percentile/Quartile Statistics

**What it is:**
- Extend `mf-calc-simple` statistics operation
- Add percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th)
- Add quartile calculations
- Add min/max outlier detection

**Why valuable:**
- Enable more sophisticated analysis
- "Is this company's margin in the top quartile?"
- "What's the 90th percentile revenue growth?"
- Better risk assessment (outlier detection)
- **Impact:** Enable advanced statistical analysis

**How to implement:**
```python
# Add to calc_statistics()
if 'percentile_25' in metrics:
    results['percentile_25'] = np.percentile(values, 25)
if 'percentile_75' in metrics:
    results['percentile_75'] = np.percentile(values, 75)
if 'quartiles' in metrics:
    results['quartiles'] = {
        'q1': np.percentile(values, 25),
        'q2': np.percentile(values, 50),
        'q3': np.percentile(values, 75)
    }
```

**Effort:** 1-2 days (implementation + testing + documentation)

**Expected benefit:**

- Automatic cache invalidation
- Cache hit/miss metrics

**Why valuable:**
- 30-40% cost reduction for repeated queries
- Faster response times (no API calls)
- Better user experience
- Reduced load on FMP API
- **Impact:** Significant cost savings at scale

**How to implement:**
```python
# Add to mf-market-get
import redis
cache = redis.Redis()

def get_cached_or_fetch(ticker, field):
    cache_key = f"{ticker}:{field}:{date.today()}"
    cached = cache.get(cache_key)
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    data = fetch_from_fmp(ticker, field)
    cache.setex(cache_key, 3600, json.dumps(data))
    return data
```

**Effort:** 2 days (implementation + testing + monitoring)

**Expected benefit:**

        best_idx = values.index(max(values))
        worst_idx = values.index(min(values))
        
        row['highlights'] = {
            best_idx: 'best',
            worst_idx: 'worst'
        }
```
