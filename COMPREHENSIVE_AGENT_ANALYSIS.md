## Issues Identified & Status

### 1. Description Parameter Architecture ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Description as separate text before tool calls
**Solution:** Made description a parameter of Bash tool
**Status:** Fully implemented and working

### 2. Model Capability Limitation ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Haiku cannot reliably execute tools
**Solution:** Use Sonnet for production
**Status:** Sonnet working perfectly (100% success rate)

### 3. Profit Margin Calculation ‚úÖ CLARIFIED
**Problem:** System prompt incorrectly suggested using `mf-calc-simple`
**Solution:** Clarified that manual division is acceptable
**Status:** Agent now calculates correctly

### 4. mf-report-save Missing Parameter ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR
**Problem:** Agent tried to use `mf-report-save` without `content` parameter
**Impact:** Low - Agent gracefully recovered
**Solution:** Could add example to system prompt or fix tool schema
**Status:** Non-blocking, agent works around it

## Architectural Improvements
