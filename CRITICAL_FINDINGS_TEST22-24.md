# Critical Findings - Test 22-24 (Tool Call Cards)

## ❌ **MAJOR ISSUES FOUND**

### 1. TOO MANY CARDS - REDUNDANT!
Looking at test-22, I see **THREE SEPARATE CARDS** showing tool execution:

1. "📊 Market Data" (blue card, no info)
2. "📊 · 0 fields · 0ms · 0B" (broken summary card - STILL showing!)
3. "📊 Market Data Ticker: NVDA Fields: 2" (NEW ToolCallCard - WITH info)

**Problem:** Cards are MULTIPLYING, not replacing. The broken "0 fields" card is STILL there!

### 2. "0 fields" CARD STILL RENDERING
Despite my "fix" to not render cards during loading, test-22 shows the broken card is STILL appearing.

**Root Cause:** The card is rendering BEFORE results arrive, then staying visible even after.

### 3. DUPLICATE TEXT STILL PRESENT  
Test-23 bottom shows duplicate text response - this is getting worse, not better.

### 4. LLM STILL CALLING `cat` COMMANDS
The logs show Haiku is STILL reading files with `cat` despite prompt instructions.

## ✅ **What Actually Works**

1. **ToolCallCard renders immediately** - Appears as soon as tool is called (GOOD!)
2. **Shows params cleanly** - "Ticker: NVDA Fields: 2" is readable (GOOD!)
3. **All three final cards work** - Summary, Profile, Quote all rendering correctly (GOOD!)
4. **Icons and colors work** - Blue for market data, 💹 for quotes (GOOD!)

## 🔍 **Detailed Analysis of Test Screenshots**

### Test-22: During Loading (2s after click)
```
[📊 Market Data]  ← NEW ToolCallCard (good)
[📊 · 0 fields · 0ms · 0B]  ← BROKEN (should NOT be here!)

[📊 Market Data Ticker: NVDA Fields: 2]  ← ToolCallCard with info (good!)

[📊 NVDA · 2 fields · 1.1s · 3KB]  ← Summary (good!)
[🏢 NVIDIA Corporation] [💹 $188.89 +1.65 ↑0.88%]  ← Profile+Quote (good!)
```

**Issue:** First TWO cards shouldn't exist. Only the ToolCallCard with params should show during loading.

### Test-23: After Results (12s after click)
Same as test-22, but also shows duplicate text response at bottom.

## 🐛 **Root Causes**

### Why "0 fields" card appears:
1. Initial tool-start event creates a state entry
2. `renderToolCard` is called
3. My check `if (isLoading && !result && !error)` returns the ToolCallCard
4. But THEN, the MarketDataCards component ALSO renders with empty data
5. Both cards show!

### Why so many cards:
1. Multiple tool calls are happening (Haiku is calling Bash multiple times)
2. Each gets its own state entry
3. Each renders its own set of cards
