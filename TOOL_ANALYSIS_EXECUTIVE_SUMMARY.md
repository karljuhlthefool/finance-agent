3. ✅ **Enhance error messages** (50% faster self-correction)
4. ✅ **Reorganize system prompt** (better tool discovery)
5. ✅ **Add statistical functions** (enables volatility analysis)

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks | **Impact:** High | **Risk:** Low

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working Well

**1. Tool Granularity**
- Atomic, single-purpose tools (mf-calc-simple, mf-extract-json)
- Broad data fetching (mf-market-get with 38 data types)
- Good composability (fetch → extract → calculate → chart)

**2. Cost Optimization**
- Path-based extraction is FREE and fast (<100ms)
- Instruction mode used sparingly ($0.03-0.05)
- Prompt caching saves 65-70% on subsequent queries
- Average cost: $0.25 per query

**3. Error Recovery**
- Agent uses mf-json-inspect on "key not found" errors
- Self-corrects chart format errors
- 100% success rate across all tests

**4. Parallel Execution**
- 3-5 companies fetched simultaneously (3-5x speedup)
- Multiple extractions in one turn
- System prompt encourages parallelization

**5. Tool Chaining**
- Clean fetch → extract → calculate → chart → report workflow
- Absolute paths passed between tools
- Consistent JSON-in, JSON-out contract

### ⚠️ What Needs Improvement

**1. Missing Operations**
- ❌ No division/ratio operation (agent calculates manually)
- ❌ No batch extraction (4 calls to get 4 fields)
- ❌ No statistical functions (std dev, variance)

**2. Error Messages**
- ⚠️ Lack actionable hints
- ⚠️ No suggested next actions
- ⚠️ No similar key suggestions

**3. Tool Discoverability**
- ⚠️ 660+ line system prompt (hard to navigate)
- ⚠️ No categorization by usage frequency
- ⚠️ Decision tree buried in middle of prompt

**4. Tool Usage Imbalance**
- 95% of calls use 6 tools (mf-market-get, mf-extract-json, mf-calc-simple, mf-chart-data, Write, mf-json-inspect)
- 5% of calls use 12+ advanced tools
- Some tools never used in tests (mf-qa, mf-doc-diff, mf-filing-extract)

## Key Findings from Trajectory Analysis

### Tool Usage Breakdown (Tests 1-10)

| Tool | Usage Count | Usage % | Cost | Latency |
|------|-------------|---------|------|---------|
| mf-market-get | 67 | 35% | Free | 2-5s |
| mf-extract-json | 58 | 30% | Free* | <100ms |
| mf-calc-simple | 29 | 15% | Free | <100ms |
| mf-chart-data | 23 | 12% | Free | <200ms |
| Write | 10 | 5% | Free | <100ms |
| mf-json-inspect | 5 | 3% | Free | <200ms |
| **Total** | **192** | **100%** | **$2.52** | **Variable** |

*Path mode only (instruction mode: $0.03-0.05)

### Observed Patterns

**Pattern 1: Data Analysis Workflow** (60% of queries)
```
mf-market-get → mf-extract-json → mf-calc-simple → mf-chart-data → Write
```

**Pattern 2: Multi-Company Comparison** (30% of queries)
```
Parallel mf-market-get (3-5 companies)
→ Parallel mf-extract-json (multiple metrics)
→ mf-calc-simple (comparisons)
→ mf-chart-data (visualization)
```

**Pattern 3: Complex Analysis** (10% of queries)
```
Multiple rounds of fetch/extract/calculate
→ Statistical analysis (manual)
→ Multiple charts
→ Comprehensive report
```

### Pain Points Identified

**1. Manual Calculations** (observed in 8/10 tests)
```
Agent response: "23.43 / 94.04 = 24.9%"
Issue: No division operation in mf-calc-simple
Impact: Not deterministic, not auditable
```

**2. Sequential Extractions** (observed in 10/10 tests)
```
Call 1: Extract revenue
Call 2: Extract net_income
Call 3: Extract fcf
Call 4: Extract shares
Issue: 4 calls for 4 fields from same file
Impact: Higher latency, more turns
```

**3. Manual Statistics** (observed in 2/10 tests)
```
Agent response: "Growth rates: 24.54%, 33.07%, 7.87%, -2.24%
Standard deviation is approximately 15.5%"
Issue: No statistical functions
Impact: Not deterministic, potential errors
```

## Recommended Improvements

### High Priority (Implement First)

#### 1. Add Division/Ratio to mf-calc-simple ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Agent manually calculates profit margins, P/E ratios, debt ratios

**Solution:**
```python
# Add ratio operation
{"op": "ratio", "numerator": 23434000000, "denominator": 94036000000, "mode": "percent"}
# Returns: {"ratio": 24.92, "formatted": "24.92%"}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates manual calculations (observed in 8/10 tests)
- ✅ Deterministic, auditable results
- ✅ Consistent formatting

**Effort:** 1-2 days | **Risk:** Low

---

#### 2. Add Batch Extraction to mf-extract-json ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Must call mf-extract-json 4+ times to get multiple fields

**Solution:**
```python
# Batch mode
{
    "json_file": "/path/file.json",
    "paths": {
        "revenue": "quarters[-1].revenue",
        "net_income": "quarters[-1].net_income",
        "fcf": "quarters[-1].fcf",
        "shares": "quarters[-1].shares_diluted"
    }
}
# Returns all 4 values in one call
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ 50-70% reduction in extraction calls
- ✅ Faster execution (1 call vs 4 calls)
- ✅ Lower latency

**Effort:** 2-3 days | **Risk:** Low

---

#### 3. Enhance Error Messages ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Errors lack actionable hints for self-correction

**Solution:**
```json
// Before
{"ok": false, "error": "Key 'historical' not found"}

// After
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "Key 'historical' not found",
    "hint": "Use mf-json-inspect. Try: points, data, series",
    "suggested_action": "mf-json-inspect",
    "similar_keys": ["points", "data", "series"]
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ 50% reduction in failed retry attempts
- ✅ Faster self-correction
- ✅ Better agent learning

**Effort:** 2-3 days | **Risk:** Low

---

#### 4. Reorganize System Prompt ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** 660+ line prompt is hard to navigate

**Solution:**
```
# 🔥 CORE TOOLS (95% usage)
1. mf-market-get ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2. mf-extract-json ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
3. mf-calc-simple ⭐⭐⭐⭐
4. mf-chart-data ⭐⭐⭐⭐
5. mf-json-inspect ⭐⭐⭐
6. Write ⭐⭐⭐

# 🔧 ADVANCED TOOLS (5% usage)
7. mf-qa
8. mf-documents-get
...
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Faster tool discovery
- ✅ Better tool selection
- ✅ Clearer usage patterns

**Effort:** 1 day | **Risk:** Low

---

#### 5. Add Statistical Functions ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** No tool for std dev, variance, correlation

**Solution:**
```python
# Add statistics operation
{
    "op": "statistics",
    "values": [24.54, 33.07, 7.87, -2.24],
    "metrics": ["mean", "std_dev", "min", "max", "cv"]
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates manual statistical calculations
- ✅ Enables volatility analysis
- ✅ Better quantitative insights

**Effort:** 2-3 days | **Risk:** Low

---
