# Test 1: Before vs After Comparison

**Query:** "Compare Apple, Microsoft, and Google's Q2 2025 performance. For each company, calculate: profit margin, ROE, revenue growth YoY, and FCF margin. Then create a comparison table and tell me which company has the best overall financial health."

## ✅ What Improved

### 1. Completion Rate: 0% → 100% ✅
**Before:** Agent hit max turns (25) without completing the task  
**After:** Agent completed successfully in 28 turns with max_turns=35

### 2. Failed Tool Calls: 6 → 1 (83% reduction) ✅
**Before:**
- 3 failed batch extractions (wrong field names: `netIncome` → `net_income`)
- 3 failed ROE extractions (wrong path: `quarters[-1].roe` → `[-1].roe`)

**After:**
- Only 1 failed tool call (comparison table schema: `metric` → `label`)
- Agent self-corrected immediately

### 3. Comparison Table Created ✅
**Before:** No comparison table (ran out of turns)  
**After:** Beautiful comparison table with 4 metrics across 3 companies

### 4. Final Analysis Provided ✅
**Before:** No final analysis  
**After:** Comprehensive analysis with winner determination:
- "Microsoft (MSFT) has the best overall financial health"
- Detailed strengths/weaknesses for each company
- Clear verdict with reasoning

## 🔍 Detailed Trajectory Comparison

### Phase 1: Data Fetching
**Before:** ✅ Perfect (3 parallel calls)  
**After:** ✅ Perfect (3 parallel calls)  
**Change:** None - already optimal

### Phase 2: Batch Extraction
**Before:** ❌ 6 failed calls (wrong field names + wrong structure)  
**After:** ✅ 3 successful calls (correct field names)  
**Improvement:** Field naming convention in prompt eliminated 3 failures

### Phase 3: ROE Extraction
**Before:** ❌ 3 failed calls + 1 inspect + 3 corrected calls  
**After:** ✅ 3 successful calls immediately  
**Improvement:** File structure documentation eliminated 3 failures + 1 inspect

### Phase 4: Calculations
**Before:** ✅ 9 successful ratio/delta calculations  
**After:** ✅ 9 successful ratio/delta calculations  
**Change:** None - already optimal

### Phase 5: Comparison Table
**Before:** ❌ Never reached this phase  
**After:** ✅ Created successfully (1 retry for schema)  
**Improvement:** Increased max_turns + decision tree guidance

### Phase 6: Final Analysis
**Before:** ❌ Never reached this phase  
**After:** ✅ Comprehensive analysis with winner  
**Improvement:** Increased max_turns allowed completion

## 📈 Impact of Specific Improvements

### Improvement 1: Field Naming Convention Section
**Added to prompt:**
```markdown
## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Field Naming Convention
**ALL field names use snake_case, NOT camelCase**
- ✅ `net_income` (NOT `netIncome`)
- ✅ `fcf` (NOT `freeCashFlow`)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminated 3 failed batch extraction calls
- ✅ Saved 3 turns
- ✅ Saved ~10 seconds

---

### Improvement 2: File Structure Documentation
**Added to prompt:**
```markdown
### key_metrics_quarter.json (DIRECT ARRAY - different structure!)
**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This file is a DIRECT ARRAY, not an object with a `quarters` key!
**Path:** `[-1].roe` (NOT `quarters[-1].roe`)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminated 3 failed ROE extraction calls
- ✅ Eliminated 1 unnecessary `mf-json-inspect` call
- ✅ Saved 4 turns
- ✅ Saved ~5 seconds

---

### Improvement 3: Comparison Tool in Decision Tree
**Added to prompt:**
```markdown
**Comparing companies/metrics?** → `mf-render-comparison` for comparison tables
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Agent immediately used comparison tool
- ✅ Created professional comparison table
- ✅ Only 1 retry needed (schema correction)

---

### Improvement 4: Increased Max Turns
**Changed:** 25 → 35 turns

**Impact:**
- ✅ Allowed agent to complete the task
- ✅ Enabled comparison table creation
- ✅ Enabled final analysis

---

## 🎯 Key Insights

### What Worked Well (Both Tests)
1. **Parallel execution** - 3 companies fetched simultaneously
2. **Batch extraction** - 5 values per company in one call
3. **Ratio operations** - Zero manual calculations
4. **Self-correction** - Agent recovered from errors

### What Improved (After)
1. **Field name accuracy** - No more camelCase errors
2. **File structure awareness** - Correct paths immediately
3. **Tool selection** - Used comparison tool automatically
4. **Completion rate** - 100% task completion

### Remaining Opportunities
1. **Comparison table schema** - Still had 1 retry (minor)
2. **Commentary** - Agent still narrated: "Perfect! Now let me create a comparison table:"
3. **Batch calculations** - Could batch 9 calculations into 3 calls

---

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Before (Incomplete)
- **Cost:** $0.14
- **Value:** 0% (incomplete task)
- **Cost per completion:** ∞ (never completed)

### After (Complete)
- **Cost:** $0.22
- **Value:** 100% (complete analysis + table + verdict)
- **Cost per completion:** $0.22

**Verdict:** 57% higher cost, but 100% value delivery. The extra cost is justified by task completion.

## 📊 Agent Behavior Quality

### Before: Grade C-
- ❌ Incomplete execution
- ❌ 6 failed tool calls
- ❌ No comparison table
- ❌ No final analysis
- ✅ Good parallel execution
- ✅ Good batch extraction (when correct)

### After: Grade A-
- ✅ Complete execution
- ✅ Only 1 failed tool call (minor schema issue)
- ✅ Professional comparison table
- ✅ Comprehensive final analysis
- ✅ Perfect parallel execution
- ✅ Perfect batch extraction
- ⚠️ Minor: Still some unnecessary commentary

---

## 🚀 Recommendations for Next Test

### Keep Testing
1. ✅ Test with even more complex queries (4-5 companies, 6-8 metrics)
2. ✅ Test with time-series analysis (charts + statistics)
3. ✅ Test with SEC filings + financial analysis

### Potential Further Improvements
1. **Reduce commentary** - Strengthen anti-pattern in prompt
2. **Batch calculations** - Add batch mode to `mf-calc-simple`
3. **Tool schema hints** - Add error messages with correct schema examples

## 📝 Conclusion

The improvements were **highly effective**:
- ✅ **83% reduction** in failed tool calls
- ✅ **100% completion** rate (from 0%)
- ✅ **Professional output** with comparison table and analysis

The agent now handles complex multi-company comparisons efficiently and accurately. The remaining opportunities are minor optimizations rather than critical fixes.

**Overall Grade Improvement:** C- → A- (significant improvement!)

**Next Steps:** Test with more complex queries to identify any remaining edge cases or optimization opportunities.
