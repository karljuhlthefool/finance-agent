## Issues Discovered & Resolved

### Issue #1: Component Export/Import Mismatches
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical (App Crash)

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) 
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. 
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, 
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check the render method of `MarketDataCard`.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Components were exported as `default` but imported as named exports
- Affected components:
  - `Badge` → Used in 7+ files
  - `InsightBubble` → Used in all card components
  - `Tooltip` → Used in 3 card components
  - `ProgressIndicator` → Used in MarketDataCard
  - `Sparkline`, `MiniLineChart`, `Waterfall`, `Gauge` → Chart components

**Fix Applied:**
Changed all component exports from:
```typescript
export default function Component({ ... })
```
To:
```typescript
export function Component({ ... })
```

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/components/ui/Badge.tsx` ✅
- `frontend/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx` ✅
- `frontend/components/ui/ProgressIndicator.tsx` ✅
- `frontend/components/agent/InsightBubble.tsx` ✅
- `frontend/components/charts/Sparkline.tsx` ✅
- `frontend/components/charts/MiniLineChart.tsx` ✅
- `frontend/components/charts/Waterfall.tsx` ✅
- `frontend/components/charts/Gauge.tsx` ✅

**All corresponding import statements updated in:**
- `MarketDataCard.tsx` ✅
- `ValuationCard.tsx` ✅
- `CalculationCard.tsx` ✅
- `QACard.tsx` ✅
- `FilingExtractCard.tsx` ✅
- `EstimatesCard.tsx` ✅
- `ToolChainFlow.tsx` ✅

### Issue #2: Non-existent Component References
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium (Build Warnings)

**Symptoms:**
```
Attempted import error: 'TrendBadge' is not exported from '../ui/Badge'
Attempted import error: 'ComparisonGauge' is not exported from '../charts/Gauge'
Attempted import error: 'SparklineWithLabel' is not exported from '../charts/Sparkline'
```

**Root Cause:**
- `CalculationCard` referenced `TrendBadge` which didn't exist
- `ValuationCard` referenced `ComparisonGauge` which didn't exist
- Some components had secondary exports that weren't being used correctly

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced `TrendBadge` with inline `Badge` usage:
```typescript
<Badge variant={
  trend === 'up' ? 'success' : 
  trend === 'down' ? 'error' : 
  'secondary'
}>
  {trend === 'up' ? '↑' : trend === 'down' ? '↓' : '→'}
</Badge>
```
- Updated `ValuationCard` to use base `Gauge` component
- Standardized on primary exports for all chart components

## Backend Logging Analysis

### Backend Event Flow (Successful)
```
[INFO] 🚀 Starting query
  prompt: "Pull market data for AAPL"

[INFO] 🎬 System initialized
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"  # Note: should be haiku!
  permission_mode: "bypassPermissions"
  tools_count: 15

[INFO] 💬 Agent response: I'll fetch comprehensive market data...

[TOOL] 🔧 Tool CALLED: Bash
  id: "toolu_01LCJxAVe19bdx..."
  cli_tool: "mf-market-get"
  metadata: {ticker: "AAPL", fields: [...]}

[TOOL] ✅ Tool result received
  ok: true
  metrics: {bytes: 525553, t_ms: 11498, fields_fetched: 11}

[INFO] 💬 Agent response: Perfect! I've successfully pulled...

[INFO] 🏁 Agent completed
  cost_usd: 0.0703254
  input_tokens: 7
  output_tokens: 572
```

### Backend Issues Identified

#### Issue #1: Wrong Model Being Used ⚠️
**Expected:** `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` (cheap testing)  
**Actual:** `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` (expensive)

**Impact:**
- Test cost: $0.07 per query (10x more expensive than Haiku)
- Haiku would be ~$0.007 per query

**Root Cause:**
- Changed `settings.py` to default to "haiku" but model string might not match SDK expectations
- Need to verify exact model identifier

**Fix Needed:**
```python
model=os.getenv("AGENT_MODEL", "claude-3-5-haiku-latest")  # Use full model ID
```

## Data Flow Verification

### 1. User Input → Backend ✅
```
User types: "Pull market data for AAPL"
  ↓
Frontend sends: POST /api/chat
  body: {messages: [{role: "user", content: "..."}]}
  ↓
API Route forwards: POST http://localhost:5051/query
  body: {prompt: "...", messages: [...]}
  ↓
Backend Agent SDK processes query
```

### 2. Backend → Frontend Streaming ✅
```
Backend emits NDJSON events:
  
1. agent.text
   {"type":"data","event":"agent.text","text":"I'll fetch..."}

2. agent.tool-start
   {"type":"data","event":"agent.tool-start","tool":"Bash",
    "tool_id":"toolu_01...", "cli_tool":"mf-market-get",
    "metadata":{ticker:"AAPL",...}}

3. agent.tool-result
   {"type":"data","event":"agent.tool-result","tool_id":"toolu_01...",
    "result":{ok:true,result:{...},paths:[...],metrics:{...}}}

4. agent.completed
   {"type":"data","event":"agent.completed","summary":"..."}
```

### 3. API Route → useChat Hook ✅
```
API Route processes NDJSON stream:
  ↓
Converts to AI SDK format:
  - Text: 0:"text content"\n
  - Data: 2:[{...metadata...}]\n
  ↓
useChat hook receives:
  - messages array (text content)
  - data array (annotations)
```

### 4. Frontend Rendering ✅
```
page.tsx useEffect watches data changes:
  ↓
Builds toolStates map from data annotations:
  {
    "toolu_01...": {
      cli_tool: "mf-market-get",
      metadata: {...},
      result: {...},
      isLoading: false
    }
  }
  ↓
renderToolCard() routes to MarketDataCard based on cli_tool
  ↓
MarketDataCard renders with props
```

## Remaining Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues: None ✅

### Medium Priority Issues:

#### 1. Duplicate Agent Response Content ⚠️
**Description:** Agent's markdown response appears twice in the UI

**Impact:** Visual clutter, confusing UX

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check if `message.content` and `message.parts` both contain content
- Verify `renderPart()` isn't being called twice
- Look for duplicate data annotations in stream

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
// In page.tsx, ensure we're not rendering both content and parts
{message.content && (
  <ReactMarkdown>{message.content}</ReactMarkdown>
)}
{!message.content && message.parts?.map(...)}  // Only if no content
```

#### 2. Model Not Switching to Haiku ⚠️
**Description:** Still using Sonnet despite settings change

**Impact:** 10x higher testing costs

**Recommended Fix:**
- Verify model identifier string
- Check if environment variable is being read
- Restart backend service after settings change
- Add model name to UI header for visibility

### Low Priority Enhancements:

#### 1. Add Tab Content in MarketDataCard 💡
**Current:** Tabs render but content area is minimal

**Enhancement:** Populate each tab with actual data:
- **Overview:** Price chart, key stats
- **Fundamentals:** Income statement, balance sheet snippets
- **Analysts:** Recommendations breakdown, price targets
- **Files:** Clickable list of all saved files

#### 2. Add Click Handlers for Action Buttons 💡
**Current:** "Chart" and "Compare" buttons are visible but non-functional

**Enhancement:**
- Chart: Open price data in modal/chart view
- Compare: Allow selecting peer companies for comparison

#### 3. Enhance Tool Chain Visualization 💡
**Current:** Single tool shown with basic status

**Enhancement:**
- Show dependency graph for multi-tool workflows
- Animate transitions between tool states
- Add collapse/expand for long chains
