## üéØ Test 1: Risk Factor Extraction

### Query
"Get Apple's latest 10-K filing and analyze their top 3 business risks. For each risk, extract: the risk title, a brief description, and assess the severity (high/medium/low). Present the results in a structured format."

### Agent Trajectory

**Tool Calls (5 total):**
1. ‚úÖ `mf-documents-get` - Fetched Apple 10-K (6.3s)
2. ‚ùå `mf-filing-extract` - Tried to extract "Risk Factors" section (failed - returned null)
3. ‚ùå `mf-qa` - First attempt with `model: "haiku"` (failed - invalid model name)
4. ‚ùå `mf-qa` - Second attempt with schema (failed - schema validation error)
5. ‚úÖ `mf-qa` - Third attempt without schema (success - 100s)

**Performance:**
- **Turns:** 7
- **Tool Calls:** 5 (3 failed, 2 success)
- **Cost:** $0.18 (saved $0.27 from cache)
- **Time:** ~120 seconds total

### Key Findings

#### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **Self-Correction**
   - Agent recovered from failed section extraction
   - Adjusted model name after error
   - Removed schema when validation failed
   - Successfully completed task despite 3 failures

2. **Quality Output**
   - Identified 3 high-severity risks accurately
   - Clear, concise descriptions
   - Professional formatting
   - Saved to `artifacts/answers/`

3. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Used Haiku model (attempted - good instinct)
   - Cache savings exceeded cost ($0.27 saved vs $0.18 spent)

#### ‚ùå Issues Identified

1. **Model Name Confusion**
   - Agent tried `"haiku"` instead of `"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"`
   - Tried `"sonnet"` instead of `"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"`
   - **Root cause:** System prompt doesn't document valid model names for mf-qa

2. **Schema Validation Failure**
   - Agent provided schema but LLM didn't return valid JSON
   - Had to retry without schema
   - **Root cause:** Schema enforcement in mf-qa is strict but LLM compliance is inconsistent

3. **Section Extraction Failed**
   - `mf-filing-extract` returned null for "Risk Factors"
   - **Root cause:** Section name mismatch or extraction logic issue

### Output Quality: A

**Extracted Risks:**
1. Global Supply Chain and Geopolitical Disruption Risk (HIGH)
2. Regulatory and Antitrust Compliance Challenges (HIGH)
3. Global Economic Volatility (HIGH)

All three are accurate, well-described, and properly assessed.

3. ‚úÖ `mf-qa` - Analyzed Apple AI strategy (115s, $0.23)
4. ‚úÖ `mf-qa` - Analyzed Microsoft AI strategy (147s, $0.32)
5-6. ‚úÖ `mf-market-get` - Fetched fundamentals (parallel, 3.7s + 5.2s)
7-8. ‚ùå `mf-extract-json` - Tried to extract R&D expenses (failed - field not in fundamentals)
9-10. ‚ùå `mf-market-get` - Tried to fetch "income" field (failed - invalid field name)

**Performance:**
- **Turns:** 22
- **Tool Calls:** 14 (10 success, 4 failed)
- **Cost:** $0.23 (saved $0.55 from cache)
- **Time:** ~280 seconds total

3. **Outstanding Output Quality**
   - Created comparison table
   - Quantified differences ($13B OpenAI investment)
   - Rated aggressiveness (Microsoft 9/10, Apple 4/10)
   - Professional, insightful analysis

4. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Attempted to get R&D data to quantify investment
   - When that failed, used qualitative evidence instead
   - Still delivered comprehensive answer

#### ‚ùå Issues Identified

1. **Field Name Knowledge Gap**
   - Agent tried `research_and_development_expenses` (doesn't exist in fundamentals)
   - Agent tried `"income"` field (doesn't exist in mf-market-get)
   - **Root cause:** System prompt doesn't document what fields are in fundamentals vs other endpoints

2. **Some Unnecessary Attempts**
   - Tried to quantify R&D spending when qualitative analysis was sufficient
   - 4 failed tool calls trying to get financial data
   - **Root cause:** Agent wanted to add quantitative support (good instinct, but not critical)

### Output Quality: A+

**Key Insights Delivered:**
- Microsoft: 9/10 aggressiveness (all-in, enterprise-first, $13B OpenAI bet)
- Apple: 4/10 aggressiveness (cautious, privacy-first, defensive)

## üöÄ Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Document Valid Model Names (5 min)

**Problem:** Agent guesses model names ("haiku", "sonnet") and fails

**Solution:** Add to system prompt:
```markdown
## mf-qa Model Names

Valid models:
- `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (cheap, fast, good quality)
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (expensive, slower, best quality)

Default: haiku (recommended for most queries)
Use sonnet only for complex analysis requiring highest quality.
```

**Impact:** Eliminate 3/8 mf-qa failures (37.5% improvement)

---

### Priority 2: Add Schema Usage Guidelines (10 min)

**Problem:** Schema validation is strict but LLM compliance is inconsistent

**Solution:** Add to system prompt:
```markdown
## mf-qa Schema Usage

**When to use schema:**
- Need structured data (arrays, objects)
- Parsing output programmatically
- Specific format required

**When to skip schema:**
- Free-form analysis
- Narrative output
- First attempt failed with schema

**Tip:** If schema validation fails, retry without schema.
```

**Impact:** Reduce schema-related failures, faster completion

---

### Priority 3: Document Data File Fields (15 min)

**Problem:** Agent guesses field names and tries wrong endpoints

**Solution:** Expand data schema section:
```markdown
### fundamentals_quarterly.json - Available Fields

**Financial metrics:**
- period_end, revenue, net_income
- ocf (operating cash flow), fcf (free cash flow)
- shares_diluted

**Balance sheet:**
- total_assets, total_debt, cash

**NOT available in fundamentals:**
- R&D expenses (use income statement or 10-K filing)
- Detailed line items (use mf-qa on 10-K)
- Segment data (use segments_* fields)
```

**Impact:** Reduce failed extraction attempts, better tool selection

---

### Priority 4: Add Qualitative Query Examples (20 min)

**Problem:** System prompt is quantitative-focused, no qualitative examples

**Solution:** Add section:
```markdown
## Qualitative Research Workflows

### Risk Analysis
1. Fetch 10-K with mf-documents-get
2. Analyze with mf-qa: "Extract top 3 risks with severity assessment"
3. Save structured output to artifacts/
