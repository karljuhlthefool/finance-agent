  - No comparison table created
  - No final analysis

### After Improvements
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
- **Turns:** 28 (10% reduction)
- **Failed Tool Calls:** 1 (83% reduction)
- **Achievements:**
  - ‚úÖ All metrics calculated correctly
  - ‚úÖ Professional comparison table created

2. Documented file structure differences (fundamentals vs key_metrics)
3. Added comparison tool to decision tree
4. Increased max_turns from 25 to 35

## üéØ Test 2: Time-Series Analysis with Statistics

### Query
"Analyze Apple's quarterly revenue trend over the last 8 quarters. Calculate the revenue growth rate for each quarter (QoQ), the average growth rate, and the volatility (standard deviation). Then create a line chart showing the revenue trend and tell me if the trend is accelerating, decelerating, or stable."
