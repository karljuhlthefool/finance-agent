# Status Report: Tool Chain Debugging Session

## Issues Identified

### 1. Tool Arguments Not Being Sent ❌ NOT FIXED YET
**Problem**: Backend code intends to send `"args"` and `"tool"` fields in the streaming events, but the frontend never receives them.

**Evidence**:
- Backend code (app.py:273) yields: `"args": display_args`
- Frontend logs show: `args: undefined`
- Console log of raw event JSON doesn't include "args" or "tool" fields

**Hypothesis**: The JSON serialization is silently failing, OR the backend isn't actually sending what we think it is.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Add explicit backend logging to print the EXACT dict being yielded
2. Add try/catch around the yield to catch any serialization errors
3. Test with a simple fixed dict to verify the streaming pipeline works

### 2. Latest Tool Card Not Rendering ❌ CRITICAL BUG
**Problem**: When multiple tools exist, the "LATEST TOOL:" debug text shows but the actual `<ToolCard>` component doesn't appear in the DOM.

**Evidence**:
- Console logs show: `[ToolChainGroup] Multiple tools, rendering latest at top + collapse button`
- Console logs show: `[ToolHeader] Rendering: {cliTool: null, status: intent, ...}` (ToolHeader IS rendering)
- But DOM snapshot shows ONLY:
  ```yaml
  - generic [ref=e65]:
    - generic [ref=e67]: "LATEST TOOL:"  ← Debug text
    - button "▶ Show 1 previous tool"   ← Button
  ```
  NO ToolCard element!

**Hypothesis**: 
- The ToolCard component IS being called (ToolHeader renders)
- But something is preventing the ToolCard wrapper from mounting or displaying
- Possibly a React key issue, CSS issue, or component structure bug

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Inspect the ToolCard component source to see if there's a conditional render
2. Check if React DevTools shows the component but it's hidden
3. Test with a simpler component to isolate the issue

### 3. Collapsed View Behavior ⏳ NOT YET TESTED
Need to click the collapse button to verify it shows all previous tools correctly.

## Files Modified

1. **`agent_service/app.py`**: 
   - Added backend logging for tool_args
   - Changed to use `metadata` as `display_args` for CLI tools
   - Simplified JSON serialization logic

2. **`frontend/app/page.tsx`**:
   - Added `console.log` for EVENT RAW JSON
   - Already passes `args` to tool store

3. **`frontend/components/agent/ToolChainGroup.tsx`**:
   - Reordered to show latest tool FIRST, then collapse button
   - Added purple debug border around latest tool
   - Added console logs for rendering

4. **`frontend/components/tool-cards/base/ToolHeader.tsx`**:
   - Added console logs for args
   - Already extracts ticker/fields from metadata

## Current State

✅ **Single tool**: Works perfectly - displays with ticker and fields
❌ **Multiple tools**: Latest tool card doesn't render (CRITICAL)
❌ **Tool args**: Still not being sent from backend
⏳ **Collapse/expand**: Not yet tested

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **PRIORITY 1**: Fix the ToolCard not rendering issue
   - This is blocking all multi-tool scenarios
   - Likely a simple React/CSS bug

2. **PRIORITY 2**: Fix args not being sent
   - Add explicit backend error handling
   - Verify the streaming pipeline works

3. **PRIORITY 3**: Clean up debug logging
   - Remove purple borders
   - Remove excessive console.log statements
   - Keep only essential logging

4. **PRIORITY 4**: Test collapse/expand behavior
   - Verify all previous tools show when expanded
   - Ensure tool cards display correctly when collapsed

5. **PRIORITY 5**: Improve args display
   - Show ALL args as key-value pairs
   - Not just selective ticker/fields

## User's Original Requirements

From their messages:
1. ✅ Tool arguments should display in cards - **PARTIALLY DONE** (metadata shows ticker/fields, but explicit args don't work yet)
2. ❌ Latest tool should be visible without opening - **NOT WORKING** (card doesn't render)
3. ⏳ Collapsed view should show all previous tools - **NOT TESTED**
4. ✅ Tool cards should be compact - **DONE** (reduced padding)
5. ✅ Progress bars should stop when done - **DONE** (verified working)

##Human: I need to run - too many issues and the progress is so slow. save everything to an .md that gives a full comprehensive accounting of everything and what the issues are and then we can pick this up later at a faster page
