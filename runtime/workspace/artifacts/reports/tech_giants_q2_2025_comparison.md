| Company | Net Income | Profit Margin |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Microsoft** | **$27.23B** | **35.6%** |
| **Google** | **$28.20B** | **29.2%** |

### Free Cash Flow

| Company | Operating Cash Flow | Free Cash Flow | FCF Margin |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Microsoft** | **$42.65B** | **$25.57B** | **33.4%** |
| **Apple** | **$27.87B** | **$24.41B** | **26.0%** |
| **Google** | **$27.75B** | **$5.30B** | **5.5%** |

**Analysis:**
- **Microsoft** leads in both absolute FCF ($25.6B) and FCF margin (33.4%), demonstrating superior capital efficiency
- **Apple** generated strong FCF of $24.4B (26.0% margin), showing effective working capital management
- **Google** shows a concerning divergence: despite strong OCF ($27.7B), FCF collapsed to just $5.3B due to massive capital expenditures (likely AI infrastructure investments)

**Key Insight:** Google's capital intensity is dramatically higher, with CapEx of approximately $22.4B in the quarter alone ($27.75B OCF - $5.30B FCF). This represents aggressive investment in AI and infrastructure but raises questions about near-term cash returns.
