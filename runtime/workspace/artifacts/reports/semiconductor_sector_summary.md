## üéØ Key Question: Who Invests Most in R&D Relative to Size?

### **Answer: Intel (29.7% of Revenue)**

| Rank | Company | R&D % of Revenue | Absolute R&D (TTM) |
|------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| ü•á | **Intel** | **29.7%** | $14.4B |
| ü•à | **AMD** | **25.1%** | $6.8B |
| ü•â | **NVIDIA** | **15.8%** | $15.8B |

### Context:
- **Intel's 29.7%** reflects both heavy catch-up investment AND revenue decline
- **AMD's 25.1%** shows aggressive commitment despite being much smaller
- **NVIDIA's 15.8%** demonstrates exceptional R&D efficiency (highest absolute $ despite lowest %)

## üîç Strategic Insights

### R&D Investment Analysis

**Intel: Highest Intensity, Challenged Returns**
- Spending 30% of shrinking revenue on R&D
- Focus on process tech catch-up (18A, 20A nodes) and foundry
- High spending reflects both commitment AND revenue struggles
- Efficiency: $3.57 revenue per R&D dollar

**AMD: Aggressive Challenger**
- 25% R&D intensity while growing 38% YoY
- Punching above weight: $7B R&D on $29B revenue
- Investing across CPU, GPU, and AI compute simultaneously
- Efficiency: $4.25 revenue per R&D dollar

**NVIDIA: Capital-Efficient Leader**
- Only 15.8% R&D intensity yet dominates AI infrastructure
- $16B absolute R&D (highest) on $166B revenue (highest)
- Prior R&D investments (CUDA, GPU architecture) generating massive returns
- Efficiency: $10.58 revenue per R&D dollar (3x Intel)

### What This Means for Investors

1. **R&D Intensity ‚â† Innovation Success**
   - Intel spends most relative to size but trails in market position
   - NVIDIA spends least (%) but leads in technology and market share
   - Execution and focus matter more than absolute spending levels

2. **AMD's 25% R&D Shows Commitment**
   - Most impressive when considering growth trajectory
   - If AMD reaches $50B revenue, 25% R&D = $12.5B (approaching Intel levels)
   - Maintaining R&D intensity while scaling = recipe for competitive strength

3. **NVIDIA's Efficiency is Remarkable**
   - Generates 3x more revenue per R&D dollar than competitors
   - Suggests prior investments created durable competitive moats
   - Low R&D % enables higher margins AND shareholder returns
