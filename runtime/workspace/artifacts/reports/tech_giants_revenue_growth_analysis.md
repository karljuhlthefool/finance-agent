## Key Insights

### Most Consistent: Microsoft (MSFT)

- **Growth Pattern:** All four years showed positive growth between 6.5% and 20.5%
- **Stability Score:** Standard deviation of only 5.36%, less than half the mean growth rate
- **Investment Profile:** Predictable, lower-risk growth trajectory

- **Growth Pattern:** Massive spike followed by normalization to ~10% growth
- **Volatility Score:** Standard deviation of 59.87%, exceeding the mean growth rate
- **Investment Profile:** High upside potential but significant variance in results

### Notable Patterns

**Pandemic Effect (2020):**
- Amazon: +145.26% (e-commerce boom)
- Meta: +124.02% (digital advertising surge)
- Google: +110.87% (digital advertising surge)
- Apple: +24.54% (relatively modest due to physical retail dependence)
- Microsoft: +6.55% (enterprise spending slowdown)

**Normalization Period (2021-2023):**
- All companies except Microsoft showed declining growth rates as pandemic effects normalized
- Apple faced its first revenue decline in FY2023 (-2.24%)

## Recommendations

- Positive growth all 4 years
- Diversified revenue across Office 365, Azure, LinkedIn, gaming

### For Growth Potential: Amazon or Meta
If willing to accept volatility for higher average growth:
- Amazon: 47.04% average growth (but 127% CV)
- Meta: 45.35% average growth (but 119% CV)
- Both have normalized and could see acceleration from AI initiatives

### Risk Considerations
- **Low Risk:** Microsoft (steady enterprise revenue)
- **Medium Risk:** Apple (product cycle dependent)
- **Higher Risk:** Google, Amazon, Meta (advertising/e-commerce cyclicality)
