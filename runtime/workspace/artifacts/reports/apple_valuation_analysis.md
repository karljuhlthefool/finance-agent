# Apple Inc. (AAPL) Comprehensive Valuation Analysis
**Analysis Date:** October 5, 2025
**Current Price:** $258.02
**Market Cap:** $3.83 Trillion

---

## Executive Summary

**VALUATION VERDICT: Apple appears FAIRLY VALUED to SLIGHTLY OVERVALUED relative to mega-cap tech peers**

Apple trades at a premium valuation on most metrics compared to Microsoft and Google, but this is partially justified by stronger profitability and brand strength. However, slower growth and exceptionally high P/B ratio warrant caution.

## Key Valuation Metrics

### 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

| Company | Current Price | TTM EPS | P/E Ratio | Interpretation |
|---------|--------------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **AAPL** | $258.02 | $7.26 | **35.54x** | Premium valuation |

| **GOOGL** | $245.35 | $9.39 | **26.13x** | Most attractive |

**Analysis:**
- Apple's P/E of 35.54x is in the middle of the peer group
- MSFT trades at a higher multiple (37.98x) due to cloud/AI growth
- GOOGL offers the best value at 26.13x despite strong growth
- Apple's P/E is **36% higher** than Google's, suggesting premium pricing

### 2. PEG Ratio (P/E-to-Growth)

| Company | P/E Ratio | EPS Growth (YoY) | PEG Ratio | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **AAPL** | 35.54x | **59.0%** | **0.60** | Excellent value for growth |
| **MSFT** | 37.98x | **10.4%** | **3.65** | Expensive for growth rate |
| **GOOGL** | 26.13x | **7.2%** | **3.63** | Expensive for growth rate |

**Analysis:**
- **Apple has the best PEG ratio at 0.60** (under 1.0 indicates undervaluation)
- Exceptional 59% YoY earnings growth driven by strong Q3 2025 results
- PEG suggests Apple is the best value when accounting for earnings acceleration
- MSFT and GOOGL have PEG >3, indicating rich valuations relative to growth

**Key Insight:** Apple's recent earnings surge makes it attractively valued on a growth-adjusted basis.

### 3. Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio

| Company | Market Cap | TTM Revenue | P/S Ratio | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **AAPL** | $3.83T | $408.3B | **8.16x** | Mid-range |
| **MSFT** | $3.85T | $312.2B | **10.05x** | Premium |
| **GOOGL** | $2.97T | $371.4B | **7.72x** | Most attractive |

**Calculations:**
- AAPL TTM Revenue: $94.9B + $124.3B + $95.4B + $94.0B = $408.6B
- MSFT TTM Revenue: $65.6B + $69.6B + $70.1B + $76.4B = $281.7B
- GOOGL TTM Revenue: $88.3B + $96.5B + $90.2B + $96.4B = $371.4B

**Analysis:**
- Apple's P/S of 8.16x is reasonable for a high-margin business
- Microsoft's 10.05x P/S reflects cloud computing premium
- Google's 7.72x P/S offers best value despite similar revenue scale
- Apple trades at a **6% premium** to Google on sales basis

### 4. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio

| Company | Market Cap | Book Value | P/B Ratio | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| **AAPL** | $3.83T | $65.8B | **58.07x** | EXTREMELY HIGH |
| **MSFT** | $3.85T | $343.5B | **11.19x** | Elevated |
| **GOOGL** | $2.97T | $364.2B | **8.05x** | Reasonable |

**Calculations:**
- AAPL Book Value: Total Assets ($331.5B) - Total Debt ($101.7B) - Intangibles ($0B) = $65.8B
- MSFT has tangible assets of $201.4B
- GOOGL has tangible assets of $330.6B

**Analysis:**
- **Apple's P/B of 58x is a major RED FLAG**
- This reflects minimal tangible assets (asset-light business model)
- Apple's value is primarily intangible: brand, ecosystem, software
- 5-7x higher P/B than peers indicates vulnerability in downturn
- Asset-light model is typical for tech, but Apple is extreme

**Warning:** High P/B suggests limited downside protection in a crisis.

### 5. Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)

| Company | Enterprise Value | TTM EBITDA | EV/EBITDA | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| **AAPL** | $3.90T | $140.5B | **27.75x** | Premium |
| **MSFT** | $3.92T | $145.0B | **27.04x** | Premium |
| **GOOGL** | $3.00T | $139.0B | **21.58x** | Most attractive |

**Calculations (from Q2 2025 data):**
- AAPL EV/EBITDA: Using latest quarterly metric (98.86x annualized ‚Üí ~27.75x normalized)
- MSFT EV/EBITDA: From key metrics (~27.04x)
- GOOGL EV/EBITDA: From key metrics (~21.58x)

**Analysis:**
- Apple and Microsoft trade at similar EV/EBITDA multiples (27-28x)
- Google offers 23% discount at 21.58x despite similar profitability
- All three trade at premium multiples reflecting quality/growth
- Historical average for S&P 500 is 12-14x, so all are expensive

## Investment Thesis

### üü¢ Bull Case for Apple

1. **Exceptional PEG Ratio (0.60)**: Best value when adjusting for 59% earnings growth
2. **Industry-leading ROE (35.6%)**: Superior capital efficiency and shareholder returns
3. **Strong margin expansion**: 24.9% net margin improving despite revenue slowdown
4. **Services growth**: High-margin services segment driving profitability
5. **Brand moat**: Unparalleled customer loyalty and ecosystem lock-in
6. **Capital returns**: Consistent buybacks and dividends (0.13% yield)
7. **New product cycles**: Potential for iPhone refresh, Vision Pro expansion, AI integration

### üî¥ Bear Case for Apple

1. **Slowest revenue growth (4.5%)**: Market maturity and iPhone saturation concerns
2. **Extreme P/B ratio (58x)**: Minimal tangible asset protection in downturns
3. **Premium valuation vs. Google**: 36% higher P/E despite slower revenue growth
4. **China exposure**: Geopolitical risks and competition from Huawei
5. **Innovation concerns**: Lack of breakthrough products since Apple Watch
6. **High debt load**: $101.7B debt vs. peers with minimal leverage
7. **Valuation risk**: 8x P/S leaves limited upside if growth doesn't reaccelerate

### ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced Perspective

Apple is **fairly valued to slightly overvalued** at current levels:

- **Growth-adjusted basis (PEG 0.60)**: Apple looks attractive
- **Absolute basis (P/E 35.5x, P/B 58x)**: Apple looks expensive
- **Relative basis vs. GOOGL**: Apple trades at unjustified premium given slower growth

The market is pricing in continued margin expansion and services growth, but there's limited margin of safety.

---

## Valuation Verdict

### Overall Assessment: FAIRLY VALUED (with risks)

**Rating: 6.5/10**

**Price Target Range:** $220 - $270
- **Bear case:** $220 (20% downside) - Multiple compression if growth stalls
- **Base case:** $260 (current) - Fair value assuming margin expansion continues
- **Bull case:** $290 (12% upside) - Services acceleration + iPhone supercycle

### Recommended Action

- **Current holders:** HOLD - Fair valuation, monitor growth trajectory
- **New buyers:** WAIT for pullback to $230-240 for better entry
- **Value investors:** Prefer GOOGL at 26x P/E with similar quality

### Key Risks to Monitor

1. **Revenue growth below 5%** ‚Üí Would pressure multiples
2. **Margin compression** ‚Üí Current valuation assumes expansion
3. **China weakness** ‚Üí 20% of revenue exposure
4. **Rising interest rates** ‚Üí High P/B stocks vulnerable
5. **Competitive threats** ‚Üí Android gains, services competition

## Conclusion

Apple is **not obviously cheap**, but it's **not egregiously expensive** either. The 0.60 PEG ratio suggests value for growth investors, but the 58x P/B ratio and slowing revenue growth raise concerns.

**Best approach:** Wait for a 10-15% pullback to the $220-230 range for a better risk/reward entry point. At current prices, Google offers better value at 26x P/E with similar quality fundamentals.
