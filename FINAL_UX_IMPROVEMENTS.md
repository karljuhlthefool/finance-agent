# Final UX Improvements - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "Run Command" → Proper CLI Tool Names

**Problem**: When agent runs CLI tools via Bash, it was showing generic "Run Command" instead of the actual tool name (e.g., "Extract from JSON").

**Root Cause**: The backend CLI tool detection wasn't catching all patterns, especially for tools called via Python imports.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced CLI tool detection in `agent_service/app.py`
- Now checks for both hyphenated (`mf-extract-json`) and underscored (`mf_extract_json`) versions
- Properly detects all CLI tools regardless of how they're invoked

**Before**:
```
⚡ Run Command
command · fundamentals_quarterly.json
```

**After**:
```
🔍 Extract from JSON
json_file = fundamentals_quarterly.json
path = quarters[-1].revenue
```

### 2. ✅ Clearer Key-Value Argument Display

**Problem**: Arguments showed as `key · value` which was unclear and hard to scan.

**Solution**: Updated argument formatting to use `key = value` with visual distinction:
- **Keys**: Bold, darker color (`font-semibold text-slate-600`)
- **Separator**: `=` instead of `·`
- **Values**: Monospace font with light background badge (`bg-slate-50 px-1 rounded`)
- Increased spacing between arguments (`gap-x-2` instead of `gap-x-1.5`)

**Before**:
```
ticker · AAPL · fields · quote · range · 1y
```

**After**:
```
ticker = AAPL    fields = quote    range = 1y
      ↑                  ↑                 ↑
    (bold)           (badge)           (badge)
```

### 3. ✅ Mandatory Action Descriptions

**Problem**: Agent wasn't consistently providing descriptions before tool calls because the instruction wasn't strong enough.

**Solution**: Updated system prompt with MUCH stronger, clearer instructions:

```
CRITICAL - Action Descriptions (MANDATORY):
Before EVERY SINGLE tool call, you MUST output ONE short sentence (5-8 words) describing what you're doing.
This is NOT optional - it's required for the UI to show users your reasoning.

STRICT FORMAT:
1. Output your brief action description (one line, 5-8 words)
2. Immediately call the tool
3. Do NOT add extra explanation between description and tool

CORRECT Examples:
"Fetching comprehensive AAPL market data"
<calls mf-market-get>

WRONG Examples:
✗ No description before tool (BREAKS UI!)
✗ "I'll fetch data using mf-market-get..." (too verbose)
```

## Visual Comparison

### Before (Issues)
```
⚡ Run Command                        ← Generic, unclear
command · fundamentals_quarterly.json ← Unclear key/value
                                      ← No description!
✓ 0.8s
```

### After (Fixed)
```
🔍 Extract from JSON                     ← Specific tool name
Extracting latest quarterly revenue      ← Description (italic)
json_file = fundamentals_quarterly.json  ← Clear key = value
path = quarters[-1].revenue              ← With badges
✓ 0.8s
```

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. **`agent_service/app.py`**:
   - Enhanced CLI tool detection logic
   - Now checks both hyphenated and underscored tool names
   
2. **`src/prompts/agent_system.py`**:
   - Rewrote action description instruction to be MANDATORY
   - Added STRICT FORMAT section with clear examples
   - Emphasized "NO EXCEPTIONS" rule

### Frontend
3. **`frontend/components/tool-cards/base/ToolHeader.tsx`**:
   - Changed argument separator from `·` to `=`
   - Made keys bold (`font-semibold`)
   - Added background badge to values (`bg-slate-50 px-1 rounded`)
   - Increased spacing between arguments

## Testing

Services have been restarted with all changes. To test:

1. **Ask**: "pull stock data for apple"
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ CLI tools show correct names (not "Run Command")
   - ✅ Arguments show as `key = value` with clear visual distinction
   - ✅ Each tool has a brief description in italics

## Impact

- **Clarity**: Users now immediately understand which tool is running
- **Scannability**: Clear `key = value` format makes arguments easy to parse
- **Context**: Descriptions provide reasoning for each action
- **Professional**: Cleaner, more polished UI overall
