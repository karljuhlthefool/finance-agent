# üîç Agent Execution Analysis - Tesla Data Query

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Query**: "now get that data for tsla"  
**Duration**: ~31 seconds  
**Cost**: $0.06 USD  
**Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS (with issues)

## Timeline of Events

### 1. Initialization (17:23:46)
```
üé¨ System initialized
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
- Permission mode: bypassPermissions
- Tools: 15 built-in tools (Bash, Read, Write, Glob, Grep, etc.)
- MCP Status: ‚ùå finance_cli:failed
```

**‚úÖ Good**: System loaded correctly with proper permissions  
**‚ùå Issue**: Custom MCP server failed to initialize

---

### 2. First Attempt - Wrong Path (17:23:52)
```
üîß Tool CALLED: Bash
Command: echo '{...}' | /Users/calebpardue/Projects/mf-agent-workspace/bin/mf-market-get
Result: ‚ùå ERROR - no such file or directory
```

**‚ùå Issue**: Agent used incorrect hardcoded path from different machine
- Path used: `/Users/calebpardue/Projects/mf-agent-workspace/bin/`
- Should be: `/Users/karl/work/claude_finance_py/bin/`

---

### 3. Self-Recovery - Path Discovery (17:23:57 - 17:24:02)

**Step 1**: Check current directory
```bash
pwd
‚Üí /Users/karl/work/claude_finance_py/runtime/workspace
```

**Step 2**: List available tools
```bash
ls -la /Users/karl/work/claude_finance_py/bin/
‚Üí Found: mf-calc-simple, mf-market-get, mf-documents-get, etc.
```

**‚úÖ Good**: Agent successfully self-corrected by exploring the filesystem  
**üí° Insight**: System prompt IS working - agent knows to look for CLI tools

---

### 4. Second Attempt - Success! (17:24:06)
```
üîß Tool CALLED: Bash  
Command: echo '{...}' | /Users/karl/work/claude_finance_py/bin/mf-market-get
Duration: 30.8 seconds
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - 14 data types fetched (527KB)
```

- Output tokens: 1,075
- Cost: $0.061355 USD
```

## üö® Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: MCP Server Initialization Failure (CRITICAL)

**Status**: `"mcp_servers": ["finance_cli:failed"]`

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå Agent cannot use MCP tools directly (`mf_market_get`, `mf_calc_simple`, etc.)
- ‚ùå Has to manually construct Bash commands with echo/pipes
- ‚ùå No tool schemas or validation
- ‚ùå More error-prone and verbose

**Root Cause:**
The MCP server **creates successfully** in isolation but fails during Claude Agent SDK initialization. This suggests:
1. SDK may have timeout during MCP handshake
2. Async initialization issue
3. SDK version compatibility problem

**Evidence:**
```python
# Server creates fine:
server = build_sdk_server()
‚úÖ {'type': 'sdk', 'name': 'finance-cli-tools', 'instance': <Server>}

# But SDK reports it as "failed" during agent init
```

---

### Issue #2: Wrong Hardcoded Path

**Problem**: Agent initially tried `/Users/calebpardue/Projects/mf-agent-workspace/bin/`

**Root Cause:**
- System prompt uses placeholders: `{{injected at runtime}}`
- These placeholders are **NOT being replaced** with actual paths
- Agent has to discover paths by trial and error

**Current Behavior:**
```python
# agent_service/settings.py
system_prompt = AGENT_SYSTEM  # Raw prompt with {{placeholders}}
```

**Should Be:**
```python
system_prompt = AGENT_SYSTEM.replace(
    "{{PROJECT_ROOT}}", str(PROJECT_ROOT)
).replace(
    "{{injected at runtime}}", str(DEFAULT_WORKSPACE)
)
```

---

### Issue #3: Duplicate Path Segments

**Problem**: Output paths have `runtime/workspace` repeated:
```
/Users/karl/work/claude_finance_py/runtime/workspace/runtime/workspace/data/...
```

**Root Cause:**
The CLI tool `mf-market-get` is likely concatenating workspace path incorrectly.

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check `WORKSPACE_ABS_PATH` environment variable
- Check CLI tool's path construction logic

---

## üéØ Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix MCP Server Initialization

**Option A**: Debug why SDK marks it as "failed"
- Add logging to MCP server initialization
- Check SDK version compatibility
- Look for async timing issues

**Option B**: Use Bash as workaround (current state)
- Agent already successfully adapted
- Works but less elegant

---

### Priority 2: Inject Runtime Paths into System Prompt

```python
# agent_service/settings.py
def agent_options() -> ClaudeAgentOptions:
    # Replace placeholders with actual paths
    enhanced_prompt = AGENT_SYSTEM.replace(
        "{{injected at runtime}}", str(DEFAULT_WORKSPACE)
    ).replace(
        "{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/bin/", f"{PROJECT_ROOT}/bin/"
    )
    
    return ClaudeAgentOptions(
        cwd=str(DEFAULT_WORKSPACE),
        system_prompt=enhanced_prompt,
        # ...
    )
```

**Impact**: Agent will use correct paths immediately, no trial and error

---

### Priority 3: Fix Duplicate Path Issue

**Investigation Required:**
1. Check `mf-market-get` CLI script
2. Verify `WORKSPACE_ABS_PATH` environment variable
3. Fix path concatenation logic

---

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

**This Query:**
- Input: 19,000 tokens
- Output: 1,075 tokens
- Cost: $0.061 USD
- Duration: 31 seconds

**Why So Expensive?**
1. Large system prompt (18,159 chars = ~4,500 tokens)
2. Trial and error (wrong path ‚Üí retry)
3. Multiple tool calls for self-recovery

**Cost Optimization:**
- ‚úÖ Fix path injection ‚Üí save 1-2 extra tool calls
- ‚úÖ Fix MCP server ‚Üí cleaner tool execution
- ‚úÖ Reduce system prompt redundancy

---

## ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **Agent Self-Recovery**: Excellent! Agent autonomously:
   - Detected path error
   - Checked current directory
   - Listed available tools
   - Corrected path and succeeded

2. **Tool Execution**: Once correct path was found, `mf-market-get` worked perfectly:
   - 14 data types fetched
   - 30 seconds (reasonable for 527KB of data)
   - Clean JSON output with provenance

3. **Permission Mode**: `bypassPermissions` allowed agent to execute tools without prompts

4. **Logging System**: New logging captured:
   - Every tool call with arguments
   - Tool results with data
   - Clear timeline of events
   - Cost and token usage

## üìä Success Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Query Success | ‚úÖ Yes | Good |

| Agent Self-Correction | ‚úÖ Yes | Excellent |
| MCP Tools Available | ‚ùå No | Critical Issue |
| Path Auto-Discovery | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual | Needs Fix |
| Cost Efficiency | $0.06 | Acceptable |

## Next Steps

1. **[CRITICAL]** Debug MCP server initialization failure
2. **[HIGH]** Implement path injection in system prompt
3. **[MEDIUM]** Fix duplicate `runtime/workspace` in paths
4. **[LOW]** Optimize system prompt to reduce token costs
